# Coffee Machine Project

This Python project simulates a coffee machine that can take orders, process payments, and make different types of coffee drinks. It uses the concept of classes and objects to model the coffee machine and its components.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the coffee machine simulation.
- `menu.py`: Defines the `Menu` class and `MenuItem` class, which represent the available menu items and their ingredients.
- `money_machine.py`: Defines the `MoneyMachine` class, which handles payment processing and profit tracking.
- `coffee_maker.py`: Defines the `CoffeeMaker` class, which manages the coffee machine's resources and coffee making process.

## Usage

To use the coffee machine, run the `main.py` script. It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the coffee machine. The available options are displayed, and you can enter your choice to order a drink or perform other actions.

The following commands are supported:

- To order a drink, enter the name of the drink as shown in the menu options.
- Enter "off" to turn off the coffee machine.
- Enter "report" to print a report of the machine's resources and profit.

## Dependencies

The project depends on the following Python libraries:

- No external libraries are used in this project.

## How It Works

The coffee machine simulation is built using object-oriented programming principles. Here's a brief overview of how the different components interact:

- The `Menu` class represents the menu of available drinks. It provides methods to get the available menu items and find a drink by name.
- The `MenuItem` class represents a specific drink item, with its name, ingredients, and cost.
- The `MoneyMachine` class handles payment processing. It keeps track of the money received, calculates the total amount, and checks if the payment is sufficient. It also tracks the profit made by the machine.
- The `CoffeeMaker` class models the coffee machine itself. It manages the available resources (water, milk, coffee) and provides methods to check if there are sufficient resources to make a drink and to make the drink by deducting the required resources.

The `main.py` script sets up the necessary objects and runs a loop to accept user inputs. It interacts with the `Menu`, `MoneyMachine`, and `CoffeeMaker` objects to process orders and perform actions based on user inputs.

## Conclusion

The coffee machine project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles in Python to create a simulated coffee machine. By organizing the code into separate classes and leveraging their interactions, the project achieves modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
